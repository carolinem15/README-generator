## Description 
This is a README generator using Node.js, Inquirer.js, and Fs (File System). This README is designed to help ease the process of writing READMEs for projects. It even gets generated right into the directory you are currently in! While constructing this project, I was able to get to practice coding in ES6 by using things like template literals and arrow functions. I was also able to familiarize myself with Inquirer.js, Fs, and Markdown.
